# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Augustus M. Snyder, and here is some basic information about me:

## About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of Alaska Fairbanks under the mentorship of Dr. Matthew Gilbert. The first chapter of my thesis focuses on the physiological responses of Antarctic fishes to hypoxia stress, using biochemical techniques and RNA-seq analyses. 
- :brain: Iâ€™m currently learning a number of new things, including working with Git/Github more effectively and transcriptomics methods
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Antarctic fish physiology, anything relating to cycling (in the Eastern US), myxosporean parasites / parasitology in general, and/or the Legend of Zelda (best video game series ever!).

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a 2.5-yr old dog named Kepler, a husky mix. Very playful, super sweet, and full of energy. We're learning to skijour together this year! Also, did you know that Alaskan Huskies have very effective counter-current heat exchange with the circulation in their extremities (i.e., paws) that enables them to withstand temps as cold as -30Â°C and below? :wolf: :paw_prints:
